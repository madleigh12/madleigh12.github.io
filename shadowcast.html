          <p>Shadow Cast was a semester long project where I and three team members were 
            tasked with creating an "interactive narrative" - i.e. a game. Each member was one of four 'leads': Acoustic, Aesthetic, Story, Technical. However, every member participated in all aspects of production.<br><br>
            The game had to be completely original and there were three stages to the development. The first stage was Pre-Production, where we came up with a design document. This document included character designs, storyboards, schedule breakdowns, and - of course - the story. Once this document was approved, we began the second stage: Development. We designed the game using a variety of softwares including but not limited to the Unity Free game engine, Audacity, and Adobe Photoshop. All characters, animations, sound effects, music, mechanics, and levels were created and implemented at this time. The final stage was Marketing. We were tasked with creating a final game deliverable along with whatever advertising we chose to create. At the end of the semester, we held an open demo in the Computer Science building at UF and later to the other groups in our class.<br><br><br>
