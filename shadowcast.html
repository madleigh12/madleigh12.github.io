          <p>Shadow Cast was a semester long project where I and three team members were tasked with creating a completely original "interactive narrative" - i.e. a game. Each member was one of four 'leads': Acoustic, Aesthetic, Story, Technical. However, every member participated in all aspects of production. Altogether, the project was broken down into three stages:<br><br>
          <strong>STAGE I : PRE-PRODUCTION</strong><br>
          This is when we came up with a design document which This document includes everything from character designs and storyboards to schedule breakdowns, risk mitigation and - of course - the story. It was during this time that we were able to flex our creative juices and come up with an original story.<br>

          <br><br><br>
          <strong>STAGE II : DEVELOPMENT</strong><br>
           We designed the game using a variety of softwares including but not limited to the Unity game engine, Audacity, and Adobe Photoshop. All characters, animations, sound effects, music, mechanics, and levels were created and implemented at this time. <br><br><br>
           <strong>STAGE III : MARKETING</strong><br>
           Finally, we had to advertise our product. We were tasked with creating a final game deliverable along with whatever advertising we chose to create. At the end of the semester, we held an open demo in the Computer Science building at UF and later to the other groups in our class.<br><br><br>
