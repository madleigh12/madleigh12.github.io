        <h2 class="title">a bit about me...</h2>
        <p>I'm Madi. Madison is a bit too formal for me.<br><br>
        I'm native to perfectly ordinary Lakeland, FL, USA and I think I found what I want to do with my life...maybe.<br><br>
        I am currently a 5th-year student in the University of Florida's Digital Arts and Sciences program - College of Engineering. I am also a musician. I played the French horn with my high school symphony and was in the Fightin' Gator Marching Band for two years.<br><br>
        At UF, I began as a Computer Engineering major, but after taking a 3D Modeling class, found that I was more passionate about combining programming and the visual aesthetic.<br><br>
        I'm a huge fan of video games, graphics, animation, cinematography and anything Star Wars or Harry Potter. Sometimes though, I do venture outside the Geekdom to play some soccer, take in some college football, cook a little bit, or maybe complete a 5K. When I say that I enjoy 5Ks, I just mean I like running in the non-timed, themed events like the Color Me Rad 5K and the Nerd Run. But if you really want to get me talking, mention New York, Broadway, or musical theatre in general. Just don't ask me to belt out a song unless you want your ears to bleed.<br><br>
        So that's a bit about me. Have a fantastic day!<br><br>
        Cheers!<br><br>-M-</p>
